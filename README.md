I used html, css, php, XAMPP, vsCode, sql.


To start project you need to:


1) install xampp

2) in folder "htdocs", you need to create folder "urlShortener"

3) paste all files in github there

4) start apache and sql modules in xampp app 

5) copy 127.0.0.1/urlShortener to your browser 


To use the url shortener you need to: 

1) sign up => input your username, password and email

2) log in => input your username & password

3) press home link
